# ulxmassban

This tool is used to mass ban people on Garry's Mod servers using ULX.

A quick way is to open the awarn menu, click offline players, and click show all players.
Take a screenshot of the ids you want to mass ban, then save it
Put the screenshot thru a image to text converter on the internet.
It will give you the steam ids in the screenshot.
you may or may not have to edit a few of them to be in the correct format.


**How it works:**

create a text file anywhere.
put a steam id on each line of the file, then save it.

click "Pick File" and select your text file.

when you are ready click START, you then have 5 seconds to back
into garry's mod, click on your console text input area and make sure you can type in it, and it will start mass banning everyone.

you must have access to ulx banid
