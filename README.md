# ulxmassban

This tool is used to mass ban people on Garry's Mod servers using ULX.

A quick way to get id's is to:
- open the awarn menu, click offline players, and click show all players.
- Take a screenshot of the ids you want to mass ban, then save it.
- Put the screenshot thru a image to text converter on the internet.
- It will give you the steam ids in the screenshot.
you may or may not have to edit a few of them to be in the correct format.


**How it works:**

- create a text file anywhere.
- put a steam id on each line of the file, then save it.
- click "Pick File" and select your text file.
- Input a reason for the ban
- click Temp Time if you do not have permissions to ban permanately.
- when you are ready click START
- *you then have 5 seconds to back into garry's mod*
- click on your console input area and make sure you can type in it.
- let the fun begin

you must have access to ulx banid
put gmod into windowed borderless to get to console faster.
